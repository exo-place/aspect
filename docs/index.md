features:
  - title: Cards
    details: Atomic units of existence — a place, a trait, a relationship, a state. Each card is a facet of being.
  - title: Edges
    details: Cards connect to other cards, forming a navigable graph. The structure of connections is the structure of the world.
  - title: Navigate
    details: Move through the graph along edges. Where you are shapes what you see and who you become.
  - title: Edit
    details: Change what's there. Editing is as fundamental as looking — the world is made by its inhabitants.
  - title: Projection
    details: The graph becomes a place. Projection turns structure into lived experience — not a diagram, but somewhere to be.
  - title: World Packs
    details: Portable semantic definitions that give the graph meaning. Kinds, edge types, actions, rules — all declarative, all shareable.
