## Navigate and Edit

MOOs gave users three primitives: **look**, **move**, and **script**. Scripting was powerful but created a barrier — the world was shaped by those who could program it.

Aspect replaces script with **edit**. The primitives become **navigate** and **edit**. Everyone who can move through the space can also reshape it.

## Cards, Not Pages

A card is small, atomic, composable. It's not a document or a page — it's a single facet of existence. A trait. A place. A relationship. A state.

Cards have edges to other cards. The graph of cards *is* the world. There's no separate map or index — the structure emerges from connections.

## Identity as Exploration

In most systems, you define who you are upfront: pick a name, fill out a profile, choose attributes. In Aspect, identity emerges from navigation. Where you go, what you edit, which edges you follow — these are the gestures of selfhood.

## Definitions Over Behavior

What something *is* matters more than what it *does*. A card's text content defines it. Behavior — if any — emerges from the definitions, not from attached scripts or event handlers.
