# Getting Started

Aspect is a card-based identity exploration sandbox.

## Core Concepts

### Cards

A card is the fundamental unit. It has content — text that describes what it is. A card might be a place, a trait, a memory, an object, or anything else.

### Edges

Cards connect to other cards through edges. Edges are the paths between cards — they form the graph you navigate.

### Navigate

You move through the graph by following edges. Where you are determines what you can see and interact with.

### Edit

You can change any card you're looking at. Editing is a first-class operation, not a privileged one.

## Philosophy

Aspect is like a MOO, but the primitives are **navigate** and **edit** — not script. You don't program the world. You move through it and reshape it.

See [Philosophy](/philosophy) for the full design rationale.
